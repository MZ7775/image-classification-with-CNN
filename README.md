This project is an AI-powered image classification system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs, which are preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and structuring them for efficient training. The CNN model is designed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers to automatically extract features like edges, textures, and shapes. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, optimized with the Adam optimizer, and evaluated using binary classification metrics. Once trained, the model can predict whether a new image is a cat or a dog with high accuracy. The project demonstrates the power of deep learning in image recognition and can be further improved with data augmentation, transfer learning, or real-world deployment via a web or mobile app .
